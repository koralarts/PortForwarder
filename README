About:
	This Port Forwarder supports multiple ports to be forwarded at one time. The user has a choice as to how he
	wants to create forwarding rules; the user can either create a config file that will include the port to be 
	forwarded, the IP of the server, and the port that will be used to connect to the server. Another way to create
	a rule is to add it manually via the "Add Rule Sidebar" which asks for the same information.

Current Features:
	1. Ability to use a configuration file to setup rules
	2. Ability to use the sidebar to create rules one-by-one
	3. Ability to delete rules

Features to be Added:
	1. Ability to start/stop services
	2. Ability to save rulesets
	3. Ability to import rulesets
